        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hey myself Bhanuj. I'm right now early stages of my development career. If you ever look back at this repo, just know wherever you're right now you've worked really hard. You're right now in quarantine period. It started on 12th March and current status is that it will end on April 15. This is due to COVID-19. You're spending time in a very efficient way. You're going good with your current girlfriend, Ishita Batra. You're working on a research paper on ecryption of medical data with Preeti Mam. You're also doing Data structure and algorithm course on udemy in python. You're a hardworker buddy. Hope you're having a good time. If not, just know things will be smoother in a while. <br> 
        Also, did you thank Ishita? She really helped you getting there.</p>
